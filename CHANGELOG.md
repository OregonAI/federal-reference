## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 2026-08-03 — Section anchors for the big PDF instruments: WIOA (157), Perkins V
  (29), IRS Pub 1075 (69) — `### ` prefixes on the documents' own heading lines,
  in both snapshot and body, adding no words (check_extraction still passes
  token-for-token). With toolkit v1.21.0 these serve as navigable subsections:
  get_document lists them and `part='SEC. 188.'` returns one section of a 900 KB
  statute alone. CJIS deferred with the reason recorded (two incompatible
  numbering systems; incorporated-standards reproduction question). Section
  DOCUMENTS were deliberately not minted: zero of ~300 Oregon mentions are
  section-shaped (2 CFR 200's split answered the opposite measurement); the
  demand trigger is recorded in scan_cited_sections.py.
- 2026-08-03 — `federal-act-name` citation scheme: bare `WIOA` / `Perkins V` /
  full act names (previously resolving to NOTHING) now resolve to their
  documents with a navigation note; `Title N` qualifiers return the title's
  section range, derived from the anchors, never hand-maintained.

### Fixed

- `as_of` and `retrieved` are now taken from the source rather than the wall clock
  (#8). `as_of` for the CFR part comes from the point-in-time date pinned in the eCFR
  URL — the document claimed 2026-07-30 while its own `source_url` said 2026-07-29.
  `retrieved` advances only when bytes were actually fetched; it previously moved
  forward on every re-run, so the older a cached snapshot got, the fresher it claimed
  to be. The superseded sections 200.53 and 200.62 no longer inherit the part's
  retrieval date: they are cut from a separately fetched point-in-time snapshot and
  now carry its date.
- `extract_cfr` no longer drops the part's own AUTHORITY block, SOURCE note, part
  heading and six subpart headings (#9). 2 CFR 200 gains 517 characters, including
  `31 U.S.C. 503; 31 U.S.C. 6101-6106; 31 U.S.C. 6307; 31 U.S.C. 7501-7507.` — the
  statutory basis for the entire part, previously absent from a corpus whose purpose
  is recording what a requirement rests on.
